# Step 4

In the dataset of houses in China, the geographic coordinates of each house are specified. Using the scatter function from the Matplotlib library, we can plot the houses based on their location and then analyze the map. Very useful information can be extracted from these maps, such as the density of different areas and the characteristics of houses in each region (having an elevator, area, price, etc.). In this step of the project, we will learn how to draw such charts together.
