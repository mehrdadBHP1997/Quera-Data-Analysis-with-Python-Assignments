# Step 3

The dataset of houses in Beijing provides us with very useful information, but sometimes we can also create new features using the existing ones. For example, by having the area and total price of each house, we can calculate the price per square meter for each house, which is an important feature in housing data analysis. In this part of the project, we will add two new features to our dataset and then use visualization tools to start drawing charts to examine the relationships between them.
