# step 4

Continuing with marketing activities, in this step, you will need to group customers based on their value to the company. For this purpose, you will use a well-known method in customer behavior analysis called RFM. In this method, three metrics are calculated for each customer:

1.Recency: The number of days since the customer's last purchase.

2.Frequency: The number of times the customer has made a purchase from us.

3.Monetary Value: The total revenue generated by the company from a customer.

These metrics represent important indicators of customer behavior. For example, the more recent a customer's purchase, the higher the likelihood that they will make another purchase. The more frequently a customer buys, the more satisfied they are likely to be, and the amount of revenue a customer generates for the company can distinguish them from other buyers.

 ### We categorize customers based on total purchase amounts and the above criteria into the following table:

 ### After that, using the if condition, we display the scores corresponding to each of the criteria for all customers.
