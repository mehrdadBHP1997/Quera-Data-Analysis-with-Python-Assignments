# step 4

Continuing with marketing activities, in this step, we will need to group customers based on their value to the company. For this purpose, we will use a well-known method in customer behavior analysis called RFM. In this method, three metrics are calculated for each customer:

• Recency: The number of days since the customer's last purchase.

• Frequency: The number of times the customer has made a purchase from us.

• Monetary Value: The total revenue generated by the company from a customer.

These metrics represent important indicators of customer behavior. For example, the more recent a customer's purchase, the higher the likelihood that they will make another purchase. The more frequently a customer buys, the more satisfied they are likely to be, and the amount of revenue a customer generates for the company can distinguish them from other buyers.
